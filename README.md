# Forest-Surevillance-UAV-Design
•	Working with a team of 5 members to design and construct a fixed wing, electric VTOL UAV that can be utilized to monitor changes and threats in a forest ecosystem.
•	Analyzed and examined many materials and selected aluminum for the structural frame. Performed stress calculations for structural members to design against failure and determine appropriate dimensions for them. 
•	Currently fabricating wing as well as fuselage component and assembling avionics systems.
